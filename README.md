# PowerGrid 

PowerGrid is a videogame as well as a project for learning openGL and C++.

## Test document

This is a test document for a Git readme.

## TODO:
* Wrap the engine up so its separated from the program by an API.
* Develop Priority heightmap for levels of control of program.
    * i.e. The debug console supercedes all keyboard commands. What does that look like in code? (it looks like a high level logic bypass obviously, we want some diagrams)
* Consider dividing low level code up into Visual elements and Logic elements.
* Remove all hardcoded paths for shaders and textures. (Note, this appears trivial, but is not actually trivial, it requires some thought.)
* Make a fallback texture for a failed texture call that says something like "uWu u dwid a fwucky wucky"
* Make button and slider on gui.
* Consider usung Conan
* Develop install packaging, test on new dev machine
